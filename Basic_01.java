/*
 * why OOP?
 * 
 * Before oops we use procedural approach in which we write step by step
 * function that is hard to manage and
 * reuse us we use oops to handle the problem using classes and object
 */

/*
 * Key points
 * Structure code in logical order(classes and object)
 * keep related obj and method together(Polymorphism)
 * Makes code reusable,modular,and scalable
 * prevent unauthorized Access
 * Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
 * 
 */

/*
 * Characteristics of an OOP
 * class
 * object
 * Abstraction
 * Polymorphism
 * Encaplution
 * Interitance
 */

// class->a class in a user-defined blueprint or tamplet by which we can create objects of same type without writing the code multiple time
/* 
object=>objects are instance of the class that represent real-worls entity.it contains state(variablws/field) and
behaviour(method)  and it is created by  class

states->variable/attribute
behaviour=>method
Identity: It is a unique name given to an object that enables it to interact with other objects.
*/

// method->A method is a block of code that perform specific task 
// it can me paremetrised or non-parameter
// return some value or can be void
// it is called using a object
